<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 1. Introduction

This project is my dissertation which got me a first-class. Markdown will only
be explaining how to set up the files.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
### 1.1 Acknowledgments

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Stephen Hunt, for
his invaluable time, guidance, and support throughout this journey. Having
achieved a first-class grade, I am immensely proud to honor the commitment and
dedication he has shown since teaching my very first class at university. I have
had the great privilege of being his student and learning from his vast
knowledge and expertise throughout my academic career. Thank you, Stephen, for
your unwavering belief in my potential, and for playing a pivotal role in my
academic success. Your mentorship has truly helped me become the scholar I am
today.

### 1.2 Abstract

This report describes the development of an algorithm to optimize the
transatlantic flight route from North America to Europe. The project aims to
identify the factors that affect this travel corridor, including weather
conditions, transatlantic wind maps, turbulence, and airplane statistics.


The project begins with an exploration phase that calculates the distance of the
great circle route. Various trigonometric methodologies involving spherical and
geodesic mathematics are introduced, and the most suitable methodology is
selected. After calculating the flight path's distance, a simulation is
conducted to optimize the flight path by adjusting the plane's course to take
advantage of tailwinds and avoid headwinds, resulting in a faster arrival at the
destination.


The final algorithm outputted a flight path that reduced flight time by 6.2
minutes compared to the regular great circle route. This optimization resulted
in a profit of $3,170.34 for the airline company.

## 2. Getting Started

Before forking the files, please, make sure you have pyton3 and MATLAB installed. MATLAB is not free, therefore, you may need to get a license. If you own a license,
please follow to MATLAB's website. The project does use additional MATLAB libraries, although if you would like to see the simulation in real-time, make sure you have MATLAB 2021b or above installed.

How to install:

- Debian/Ubuntu
    1. Install using [apt-get](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get).
        ```sh
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install python3
        ```
- macOS
    1. Install [Brew](https://brew.sh).
    2. Install Python using Brew.
        ```sh
        $ brew install python3
        ```
- Windows
    1. Download Python from the [Windows Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) page.
    2. Run the installer.
        - Be sure to _check_ the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's normally off by default).

<!-- SET-UP -->
## 2.1 Setting up MATLAB

1. Download project files.
2. Run MATLAB.
3. On the left pane, go to the directory where the project files are located.
4. Launch all of the MATLAB project files on the editor by double clicking on each of them.
5. Make sure you are on `Path_Optimisation_Gelbul.m` file on the editor.
6. To see each section one by one, use the `Run Section` button, simply press `CTRL + ENTER`.
7. After running the first section, a panel should appear with the title Figure 1, where you will be able to see the changes.
